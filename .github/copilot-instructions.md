# Copilot Instructions
#
# Project Initialization Log
#
# The following actions were performed to set up the project:
# 1. Initialized a Vite project with TypeScript using pnpm as the package manager.
# 2. Created a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules, dist, rom, and other common folders.
# 3. Added a copilot-instructions.md file for session tracking and instructions.
# 4. Installed and configured SCSS support (sass) for Vite.
# 5. Created a src folder with main.ts and main.scss for entry code and styles.
# 6. Added Google Fonts (Roboto) to both HTML and SCSS for consistent typography.
# 7. Created a single index.html file as the project entry point.
# 8. Configured vite.config.ts for SCSS, alias, and dist output.
# 9. Updated package.json with Vite scripts (dev, build, preview) and metadata.
# 10. Upgraded Node.js to v22.12.0 for Vite 7 compatibility.
# 11. Ran pnpm run build to generate minified JS and CSS in the dist folder.
